### Describe Latent Dirichlet Allocation Process ###

## Topics ##
# How do we determine which "topics" are in a doc
# Math & Statistical techniques like (LDA)

## Latent Dirichlet allocation ##
'''
basis: assumes a doc is a mixture of topics and all words in
doc (after removal of stop words, stemming, lemmatization)
belong to a topic
(Each doc is a mixture of topics and each topic is a mixture
is a mixture of words)
'''
# LDA is an unsupervised learning (clustering)
# parameter to specify when fitting LDA is number of topics

## Follow-Along ##
'''
Hypothetical topic we want to find:
1) "Many people have believed that the summer season is hot because the Earth is closer to the Sun."
2) "Would the state of liquid water change to a solid or gas on the surface of the Moon?"
3) "After discussing their problems, the underlying issue began to surface."
4) "The recipe did state specific cooking directions but didn't indicate how to season the food."
5) "The state needs to issue the document."
